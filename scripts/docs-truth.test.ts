/**
 * Contract test for the claims the repository makes about itself (issue #22),
 * extended to the command surface for the PRD's whole-document acceptance (#17).
 *
 * Three failure modes are covered, all of which had already happened:
 *
 * 1. **Dead pointers.** The project doc named `/docs` as the single source of
 *    truth for business requirements while no such directory existed, and
 *    listed `src/components/` in a tree that did not contain it. A documented
 *    source of truth nobody can open is worse than no pointer at all.
 * 2. **Copied literals.** The README embedded the Worker configuration verbatim,
 *    including a `compatibility_date` the weekly dependency bot bumps. Every bump
 *    made the README staler. The fix is to delete the copy rather than to sync it:
 *    teaching the bot to rewrite prose automates a problem better removed, and a
 *    drift test would turn every legitimate config edit into a two-file edit.
 * 3. **Commands that do not run.** Both docs told the reader to run `pnpm deploy`,
 *    which pnpm resolves to its own workspace-deploy built-in and never to the
 *    script of that name. The PRD's acceptance is that *every* command printed in
 *    the docs runs as written, so the whole `pnpm` surface is checked here rather
 *    than only the deploy commands — those carry extra, deploy-specific
 *    obligations asserted in `scripts/deploy-scripts.test.ts`.
 *
 * **Scope.** A "pointer" here is a backticked token rooted in one of the tracked
 * directories, or a relative markdown link target. Package names and gitignored
 * env files are deliberately out of scope as pointers — they are not claims about
 * the tree. Shell commands are not tree claims either, but a printed `pnpm <name>`
 * *is* a claim about the script surface, so it is checked separately below. The
 * `--with-db` section is excluded throughout because it describes what
 * `init-project --with-db` scaffolds, not what is present.
