/**
 * Contract test for the deploy script surface.
 *
 * Two defects this locks out, both silent:
 *
 *   1. `deploy` is a pnpm built-in (workspace deploy), so `pnpm deploy` never
 *      reaches a script of that name — the documented command simply errored.
 *   2. The obvious workaround, `wrangler deploy` with no `--env`, succeeds and
 *      publishes to the *top-level* Worker, which none of the three declared
 *      environment blocks owns. That is a fourth live Worker nobody manages and
 *      nothing in the repo mentions.
 *
 * Every deploy path must therefore name its environment, and that environment
 * must be declared in wrangler.jsonc. See issue #19.
