# Astro on Cloudflare

*AI agent index: [llms.txt](./llms.txt) — generated from `AGENTS.md` and `.claude/` by `pnpm gen:llms-txt`, served at `/llms.txt`*

A production-ready **template** for building content-first sites and SSR apps on Cloudflare Workers with Astro. Ships with Tailwind CSS v4, native Astro API endpoints, a strict Biome + Vitest toolchain, an optional Drizzle + Neon data layer, and the full Auditmos baseline (simple-git-hooks, knip, taze, semantic-release, `.claude/` rules).

Use it as the starting point for your next project — clone it, rename it, decide whether you want the data layer, and start shipping.

## Using this Template

1. Click **Use this template** on GitHub (or `gh repo create --template`).
2. `pnpm install`.
3. `pnpm run init-project` — prompts for a kebab-case project name, renames `wrangler.jsonc` + `package.json`, and fans out `.env.example` → `.env` and `.dev.vars{,.staging,.production}.example` → `.dev.vars` / `.dev.vars.staging` / `.dev.vars.production`. Pass `--with-db` to add the Drizzle/Neon data layer scaffolding. Idempotent — re-runnable, never overwrites filled-in files.
4. *(Only if `--with-db`)* Provision a Neon database and fill `DATABASE_HOST/USERNAME/PASSWORD` in `.dev.vars` (and the staging/production variants when you deploy them).
5. Run `pnpm cf-typegen && pnpm dev`.

See [Quick Start](#quick-start) below for the dev-loop commands.

## Why this template

- **Edge-first** — Astro `output: "server"` running on Cloudflare Workers via `@astrojs/cloudflare`. Bindings typed automatically through `worker-configuration.d.ts`.
- **No framework lock-in** — pure Astro by default. Add React/Vue/Svelte islands per project with `pnpm astro add <integration>` only when you actually need them.
- **Type-safe end-to-end** — `astro check` + strict TypeScript, Zod at every endpoint boundary, typed Cloudflare `Env`.
- **Three-env wrangler** — `dev`, `staging`, `production` blocks shipped out of the box, one Worker each. Deploy with `pnpm deploy:staging` / `pnpm deploy:production`.
- **Agent-friendly** — project rules in `.claude/rules/` activate automatically based on the files you touch. Mirrors the conventions of every other Auditmos template repo (`saas-on-cf`, `tstack-on-cf`, `hono-on-cf`).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate Cloudflare Env types
pnpm cf-typegen

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

The app runs on http://localhost:3000.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `pnpm dev` | Dev server on port 3000 (Astro + Vite) |
| `pnpm build` | Production build to `./dist` |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `pnpm deploy:dev` / `pnpm deploy:staging` / `pnpm deploy:production` | Build and deploy to the named Cloudflare environment |
| `pnpm cf-typegen` | Generate `Env` types from `wrangler.jsonc` |
| `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:watch` / `pnpm test:coverage` | Vitest |
| `pnpm types` | `astro check` + `tsc --noEmit` |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` | Biome check / auto-fix |
| `pnpm knip` | Detect unused files, deps, and exports |
| `pnpm deps` / `pnpm deps:update` | Check / apply dependency updates via taze |
| `pnpm release` | semantic-release (CI only) |

If you opted into the data layer with `--with-db`, you also get `db:generate:{dev,staging,production}`, `db:migrate:*`, `db:pull:*`, `db:studio`, and `db:seed:*` — all wired through `@dotenvx/dotenvx`.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── pages/                       # File-based routes
│   ├── index.astro              # Landing page

├── health/                      # The pure module it delegates to, plus its tests
├── layouts/

└── env.d.ts                     # App.Locals typed against CF Env
```

Path alias `@/*` resolves to `src/*`.

Reusable components get their own folder under `src/` when a second page needs one,
and a domain module gets `src/<domain>/` when the domain appears — following
`src/health/`. The template ships no empty directories waiting to be filled.
`docs/` holds business requirements and design docs; `plans/` holds phased
implementation plans.

## Cloudflare Integration

### Worker configuration

[`wrangler.jsonc`](./wrangler.jsonc) is the source of truth — read the values there,
not here. This README used to reproduce the file inline, which meant the weekly
dependency bot bumped the real compatibility date and left the copy a little more
wrong every time. The copy is gone rather than synced: teaching the bot to rewrite
prose automates a problem better deleted. `scripts/docs-truth.test.ts` fails if a
copy is reintroduced.

What the file declares:

- Worker name, entrypoint, compatibility date and flags (`nodejs_compat`)
- `assets` — `./dist` served through the `ASSETS` binding
- `observability` with an explicit head sampling rate, plus source map upload
- Three `env` blocks — `dev`, `staging`, `production` — one Worker each
- Commented example blocks for the bindings you are most likely to add next

Conventions:

- Use `wrangler.jsonc`, not `.toml`.
- Prefer `custom_domain: true` over routes with `zone_name` — see [`.claude/rules/cloudflare-deployment.md`](./.claude/rules/cloudflare-deployment.md).
- Run `pnpm cf-typegen` whenever you add bindings to regenerate `worker-configuration.d.ts`.

### Accessing bindings

```ts
// src/pages/api/hello.ts
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";

export const GET: APIRoute = () => Response.json({ env: env.CLOUDFLARE_ENV });
```

In Astro v6 + `@astrojs/cloudflare` v13 the `Astro.locals.runtime` proxy is gone — `import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"` is the only supported path for bindings and vars.

### Secrets & environments

Per-environment vars live in `.dev.vars` / `.dev.vars.staging` / `.dev.vars.production`, never committed. This matches the wrangler convention — `.dev.vars.<env>` is loaded ahead of `.dev.vars` when `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=<env>` is set ([docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#local-development-with-secrets)). For staging/production, mirror the same keys as Cloudflare secrets via `wrangler secret put --env <name>`.

### Deploying

```bash
pnpm deploy:dev         # build + wrangler deploy --env dev
pnpm deploy:staging     # build + wrangler deploy --env staging
pnpm deploy:production  # build + wrangler deploy --env production
```

Every deploy command names its environment, and there is deliberately no environment-less one. The old bare script was unreachable — `deploy` is a pnpm built-in (workspace deploy), so the package manager answered instead of the script — and the wrangler invocation it wrapped published to the *top-level* Worker, which none of the three `env` blocks owns. That is a fourth live Worker nobody manages. `scripts/deploy-scripts.test.ts` fails if such a script is reintroduced.

**Deploys are manual by design.** CI gates lint, types, tests, dead code and the production build, but never ships — a template its consumers clone must not demand a `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` they have not created. To automate it for your own project, add a workflow step running one of the commands above with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in the job environment; see [Wrangler CI/CD](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/ci-cd/).

## Optional: Drizzle + Neon data layer

Re-run `pnpm run init-project --with-db` (or pass the flag the first time) to scaffold:

- `drizzle-{dev,staging,production}.config.ts`
- `src/db/{client,health,schema.ts,setup.ts}`
- `db:*` scripts wired through `@dotenvx/dotenvx`
- `DATABASE_HOST/USERNAME/PASSWORD` keys in every `.dev.vars{,.staging,.production}.example`

Same conventions as `tstack-on-cf` and `hono-on-cf`: domain-per-folder, narrow public API, per-env migration directories.

## Agent Rules & Design Docs

This template is set up for agent-assisted development:

- `CLAUDE.md` → symlink to `AGENTS.md` — project-wide agent guide.
- `.claude/rules/` — topic rules (`general.md`, `deep-modules.md`, `error-handling.md`, `atomic-imports.md`, `cloudflare-deployment.md`, plus `frontend/{astro,tailwind-v4}.md` and `api/{cloudflare-workers,astro-endpoints}.md`) that activate automatically based on the files being edited.
- `.claude/agents/` — `dd-w` (design-doc writer), `dd-i` (design-doc implementer), `mvp-e` (MVP enforcer).
- `/docs` — single source of truth for business requirements / design docs.
- `llms.txt` — the agent index, **generated** from the two above by `pnpm gen:llms-txt`. `public/llms.txt` symlinks to it so a deployed clone serves it at `/llms.txt`; there is no second copy to keep in sync. A drift test fails if the committed file falls behind the tree.
